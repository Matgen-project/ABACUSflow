This library file includes 68 standard orbitals for 68 elements, which are generated for SG15 v1.0 pseudopotential with Ecut = 60 Ry.

For more details of input and output, please see the subfolder "info", such as "Si/info/".

Important: Note that the atomic bases are optimized for particular pseudopotentials, which means that when a pseudopotential changes, the atomic bases must be regenerated. When use a atomic basis set, one should choose the bases with reference energy that is closest to the one used in the calculations.
